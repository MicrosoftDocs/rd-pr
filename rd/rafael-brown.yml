  description: Microsoft Regional Director and Chief Architect at SSW in Sydney, Australia
remarks: |
  ## Bio
  As Chief Architect at SSW, I build custom software solutions for clients such
  as Microsoft, Worley Parsons and Aurecon using the technologies of ASP.NET
  MVC, SharePoint or CRM, usually powered by Azure or SQL Server. I am a
  Certified Scrum Trainer with scrum.org, training developers in Australia, the
  US, UK and Europe. I love contributing to scrum.org and speaking at
  conferences such as Ignite and NDC in my role as a Microsoft Regional Director
  and MVP. I also interview leading software guys building great solutions on
  the Microsoft stack at [http://tv.ssw.com](http://tv.ssw.com/).
  
  From 2005-2010, I swam with the Bondi Icebergs every Sunday in Winter and was
  inducted as a Lifetime Iceberg.

  ## Spotlight
  I first got involved with Microsoft development in 1990 and I’ve been learning
  and teaching since then. Software development has changed massively since
  then, but one steady constant has always been learning. Learning with the
  community is incredibly rewarding – I guess that’s why I have been running a
  user group for 25 years!
  
  Developer user groups have an altruistic foundation and bring people together
  to improve programming and software solutions by sharing hard-won knowledge
  and experience. However, once the user group is over, how do we find that
  information again? Knowing that information exists, and being able to access
  that knowledge are 2 very different things.
  
  I’ve been running the Sydney .NET user group for more than 20 years, and the
  Canberra .NET user group for 10 years, and over this time we’ve had some
  really valuable sessions that I wished we could have saved. Therefore in 2012
  I launched SSW TV <http://ssw.tv> , in part as a way to record and store our
  user group sessions to ensure that the sessions don’t evaporate once the
  presenter stops speaking. SSW TV now has more than 100 user group sessions
  online so that any developer, anywhere in the world, can easily and freely
  access the knowledge as if they had have been in Sydney on the night.
  
  Most of the sessions on SSW TV are filmed in Australia, but analytics from the
  videos show that our primary audiences are in places like the USA and India. I
  love knowing that geography is no longer an obstacle to achieving the benefits
  that user groups provide – and I’m proud to have been a part of sharing that
  .NET, Web and Azure love with the world.
