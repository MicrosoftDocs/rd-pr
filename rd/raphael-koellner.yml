  ## Bio
  [My name is Raphael Koellner and I combine the law and the information technology especially cloud computing and global compliance, IT and information security and DSGVO. As a CEO of Microsoft Partner [KöllnService GmbH]( https://koellnservice.de/) – an IT and Compliance consulting firm – I work for international companies to migrate and implement multi cloud solutions on a technical, data privacy and compliant way. To connect this law topics with the IT topics excites me every day. Furthermore, I am the founder of digitallawyer. 

  Since 2013 I am MVP for M365 Apps & Services, Windows Insider MVP since the beginning and Microsoft Azure MVP. I am the community guy and lead for example the [Office 365 Usergroup Germany](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/office-365-meetup/), the [Azure Meetup Cologne](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Azure-Cologne-Meetup/), the biggest Windows 10 Insider Community in Germany and founded the #Compliancefam. I love to connect and share knowledge with community passionated people and run for example the TeamsCommunityDay and the Global Compliance Conference. I am also speaking on international and national conferences like Ignite, BUILD, Ignite the tour, Techorama or local community events with a lot of passion. A view from different sites are a key to find the best solutions for my customers. I love to fly my drone, read books and play tennis. Most important for me is my family and spending time with them.
