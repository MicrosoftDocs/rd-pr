  ## Bio
  Hi, I am Alexander Wechsler, a consultant, architect, developer, entrepreneur,
  who has been working many years in project and partner management for
  customers in the enterprise and embedded market. Many of my projects turned
  into best practice showcases for the successful use of modern software
  technology.
  
  I am the founder and CEO of Wechsler Consulting GmbH & Co. KG, a consulting
  company delivering first class IT consulting services based close to Munich,
  Germany.
  
  As one of the international leading specialists I speak at IT/developer
  conferences and at universities on application and system architectures using
  the newest Microsoft technologies.
  
  For my work on educational methods, courses for developers as well as project
  managers I have been recognized several times with national and international
  “Enterprise Knowledge Management” and “Best Practice” awards.
  
  In 2006 I was elected as a Microsoft Regional Director for Germany and am very
  proud to work in this senior group of people to advance and innovate the
  Microsoft technology eco-system in all areas.
  
  Talk to me about:
  
  Azure Cloud Computing, Azure IoT, Software Engineering, Device and System
  Management, Enterprise Architectures, Mobile Development, Microservices,
  Machine Learning, C#, .NET, Arduino, Roboticss, Cross-Platform Development

  ## Spotlight
  My passion in the field of digital innovation is to serve as a pathfinder to
  explore new ways to solve problems for customers as well as community.
  Together with early adopters, I help sort out the dos and don’ts in new
  technology areas and provide this valuable insight through blog posts,
  educational courses and directly as a digital architect.
  
  Our digital world is changing at lightning-speed, making it hard for even
  seasoned professionals to keep pace. Cloud Computing is at the forefront of
  these changes. Tasks will be accomplished easier and faster than ever before
  and artificial intelligence systems will act proactively, saving valuable
  time.
  
  In this transition, there is huge potential to improve many issues we face as
  individuals, companies or even as societies. Such issues range from simple
  day-to-day tasks like buying food or scheduling meetings to highly advanced
  professional systems, planning manufacturing processes or airplane
  maintenance. Social networks, digital democracy, and virtual/augmented
  realities have already altered the way we live our lives and how we
  communicate.
  
  I support customers’ transition to the modern Cloud era by developing highly
  efficient and scalable architectures that meet the agile needs of modern
  solutions, while simultaneously reducing privacy and reliability risks.
