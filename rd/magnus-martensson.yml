  ## Bio
  I am an Entrepreneur and Consultant in the Cloud Business and Architecture
  field from Malmö, Sweden, and CEO of the consulting company
  <http://loftysoft.com>.
  
  My greatest passion is to help my customers realize their Cloud Computing
  dreams, teaching them to fly on their own, and achieve much more for their
  business using the Microsoft Azure Cloud. I'll provide you with a map and a
  compass for how to get to the Cloud quickly and with focus on the right path
  form the start.
  
  As CEO of Loftysoft I am constantly on the move, as a speaker on a stage near
  you, delivering training to those that seek greater insight into the Cloud, or
  consulting and bringing true value to my customers everywhere.
  
  I am a passionate community enthusiast on a global scale and run events such  as <http://global.azurebootcamp.net> and
  <http://cloudburst.azurewebsites.net>.
  
  As the first Microsoft Azure Most Valuable Professional in the Nordic
  countries/regions in 2012 I was awarded MVP of the year for my technical depth of
  knowledge about the Azure Platform. As a Microsoft Regional Director I work
  closely with my partner Microsoft on a business and strategic level to help my
  customers and Microsoft alike.
  
  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing, PaaS, SaaS, (IaaS), Software Engineering,
  Microservices, Serverless Compute, Software Architecture, DevOps, Visual
  Studio Team Services (VSTS), Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD), Project
  efficiency, Development and Test environments, Automation, C#, ASP.NET, Cloud
  Strategy, Cloud Business, Multitenant.

  ## Spotlight
  Working with customers all over the world and presenting on an international
  stage of conferences has been a great opportunity to see our world and meet
  people from high in the Himalayas to low down under. Everywhere I go one thing
  remains the same: people are eager to learn how to succeed! In my opinion the
  best way to gain new knowledge is to share yours. My personal quest is to
  bring more sharing into the world!
  
  As an avid community proponent, I proudly share knowledge at conferences and
  meetups, some of which I also create. Most notably I am one of the admins
  behind the Global Azure Bootcamp which is perhaps the largest reoccurring
  developer community event in the world with close to two hundred event
  locations and over ten thousand attendees on a single day. Hundreds of
  organizers join in the fun and spread knowledge and excitement about the
  Cloud. We created this event to fuel peoples’ passions and challenge our frame
  of reference. #globalazure attendees also experience that people all over the
  globe are as passionate as they are to learn, share and grow together. If
  sharing is caring, this event shares on a global scale!
