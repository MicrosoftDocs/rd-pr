  ## Bio
  I’m Sebastian Fyda and I'm an Infrastructure Architect and IT consultant deeply dedicated to the Open Source community.
  I’ve been in the IT industry for over 15 years, but my adventure with Linux started almost 20 years ago.
  As a hands-on type of person, I enjoy influencing best practices — either Dev/Ops, Software Lifecycle or simply
  the organizational matters — in companies I do business with and watching how that helps them thrive.

  Currently I’m serving as the Senior Cloud Solutions Architect at Synerise, praised by Satya Nadela
  himself, a Polish startup that delivers an AI-driven next-generation growth cloud.

  On top of that, I’m a frequent speaker/trainer at local Universities, industry gatherings and private corporate events around
  Poland as well as an active member of the Azure Advisors community.

  Prior to my recognition as a Microsoft Regional Director, I actively engaged and converted to companies that
  could benefit most from the transition to Azure and helped them navigate the path leading to Cloud Operations and proper
  DevOps culture. Being a trusted advisor to multiple CEO/CTOs and wining appreciation of developers and
  SysOps alike allowed me to convert every single Bizspark+ benefit, that was granted on my behalf into a successful
  cloud deployment with either EA or Open Subscription.  As an RD I continue that journey with even greater possibilities
  than before.

  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing,  Kubernetes, Machine Learning,  DevOps

  ## Spotlight
  As an IT Pro, I’ve have noticed that many IT-related organizations struggle with mostly the same problems, ranging
  from software lifecycle management, through performance and ending with security. This is most commonly visible at
  cloud-native startups, deep into usage of microservices, where “DevOps” is mistaken for a team or an engineer and
  good system design is bypassed with  bunch of Ansible modules being executed.

  This is likely due to how easily organizations can deploy to the cloud and new things can be built so quickly.
  It’s important to make them aware of how to build robust development pipelines and secured cloud environment,
  not only to easily deploy them but to maintain them going forward. I always try to provide some experience-based insight on how
  things can be improved or should be designed and really enjoy it when my suggestions are put into practice and prove themselves in business environment.
