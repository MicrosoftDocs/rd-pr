  ## Bio
  I'm Reza Rad, based in New Zealand. A Microsoft Regional

  I run my own consulting business named RADACAD.
  I am not a Microsoft employee, but my activities including writing books, speakring 
  in many conferences, writing blogs, and many others counted for Microsoft to be kind 
  to me and award me as the Most Valuable Professional since 2011. I have been a 
  developer on Microsoft technologies for a while, and worked for many consulting 
  businesses around the world as a consultant. In 2014 I founded RADACAD as a training 
  and consulting business focusing on Data Analytics technologies of Microsoft.
  
  I'm [an author of many books on Power BI, and SQL Server]

  Business Application Summit, and I run workshops in many countries around the world.

  ## Spotlight
  I grow from the community, I learned anything by reading books, reading blogs,
  watching videos, and self learning. I did all that because there were materials
  on the internet or other media shared by generous people. I want to do the same
  for others. I want to produce materials in all media channels for everyone to 
  learn and grow in the technology.
  
  I run conferences [Difinity](http://difinity.co.nz), User group events [NZ BI User 
  Group], write books, speak in conferences, write blogs. All of that to help the 
  community. I believe in one sentense: Never Stop, Never Give up. If you have any
  questions and challenges in Microsoft Data Analytics technologies, feel free to

  read my books, blogs, watch my training courses and vidoes. If you want to follow
  this path, I can help you.
