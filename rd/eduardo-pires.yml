  ## Bio
  I'm a software developer and architect. My main focus is on developing architectures for large applications.
  
  I have also been MVP since 2014 and my mission is to share knowledge about good software development practices and focus on performance and security.
  
  As an owner in the company Developer.IO I develop content for various courses on software development. I also work as a consultant for large companies, multinationals and state companies.
  
  As an owner at DevXperience I organize technical events. These events occur once or twice a year and typically receive between 700 and 1000 visitors per edition.
