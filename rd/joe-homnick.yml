  ## Spotlight
  I have always gravitated to the concept of “Making Data Intelligent” during my
  over 30 years in the IT industry and over 20 as a Microsoft Regional Director. My
  background as a CPA has helped immensely as my company has concentrated in
  delivering Blockchain and Business Intelligence (BI) integration into Enterprise Business Process Management 
  enterprise computer systems.
  
  With the release of Cortana Analytics, Power Platform and Blockchain Service, we have seen huge benefits leveraging
  Blockchain, Machine Learning and Power BI into Business Process Management Solutions.
  
  I take pride in making complex digital solutions easy to understand for both the Business Stakeholders and 
  Information Technology implementors
