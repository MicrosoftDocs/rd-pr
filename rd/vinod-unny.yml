  ## Bio
  Hi there!
  
  I'm Vinod Unny, the Owner of [Enterprise
  InfoTech](http://www.enterpriseinfotech.com), a technology consultancy company
  based in Gurgaon, India. My role is that of a Senior Technology Consultant. I
  am an active member of India’s Information Technology community. I've lead
  both technical and techno-business teams in the United States, Japan and of
  course in India and have traveled widely and regularly, both in India and
  around the world for projects and events.
  
  I've been an active and popular speaker in many different technology seminars
  across the country/region. My speaking engagements range from large industry
  conferences to private events of many management & technical institutes as
  well as organizations. I also conduct trainings, both online and on-site, for
  tech teams on latest technologies and have trained employees of companies from
  across the world.
  
  I'm proud to be a Microsoft Regional Director for many years now. It allows me
  to work closely with Microsoft and clients, both theirs and ours, to provide
  technology solutions that are effective.
  
  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing, Information Management and Security,
  Software Architecture, Network Infrastructure Architecture, Software
  Development, C#, ASP.NET, SharePoint, Office 365, SQL Server, Windows Server,
  Windows Client

  ## Spotlight
  My role as a senior technology consultant and advisory member involves helping
  organizations use technology effectively to design and implement
  infrastructure, increase productivity through software, and minimize data
  security risks.
  
  For instance, I have helped a micro-finance organization implement a solution
  for its consumers in India using Azure SQL Service. I’ve also implemented an
  IaaS + SaaS solution using Azure + Office 365 for another client to migrate
  their on-premises deployments. And it doesn’t stop there.
  
  I’ve noticed that while many of these organizations have heard of the term
  "cloud", they are unsure of its true meaning and what it entails to move to
  the “cloud’. Helping them understand the ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘how’, and even ‘if’
  they should implement cloud solutions has been one of my key tasks in recent
  times. In my opinion, educating the top management and employees of an
  organization in latest technology trends such as cloud and big data is even
  more important than managing technical challenges and risks.
  
  In this respect, I've held preparatory trainings to bring organizations up to
  speed with technologies. Such activities, in turn, have helped me design and
  deliver solutions that meets their needs more effectively.
