# Microsoft Regional Director (RD) Program Code of Conduct

## Overview

Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This includes the Regional Director (RD) Program where Microsoft seeks to provide a respectful, friendly, professional and inclusive experience for everyone.

Microsoft Regional Directors (RDs) are business professionals and technology experts who thoughtfully share their knowledge and expertise with Microsoft, business decision makers, and the community. The RD Program is Microsoft’s way of recognizing these individuals. As community leaders, we expect RDs to demonstrate our values by conducting themselves with professionalism, respectfulness and tact whenever they engage with others within and outside the Program. In other words, an individual’s character and leadership truly matter to Microsoft.

This Code of Conduct summarizes Microsoft’s minimum expectations for RDs.

Microsoft makes this Code of Conduct highly visible to clarify expectations, provide reporting resources for conduct violations and outline how Microsoft may choose to enforce this Code of Conduct. Microsoft reserves the right to amend or change this Code of Conduct at any time, without notice. RDs agree to periodically review this document to ensure they are in compliance with the obligations below.

## Expectations

Microsoft does not tolerate any behavior that is degrading to any individual in any form. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to, discrimination based on gender, race, religion, age, physical appearance, sexual orientation, disability, or any behavior that would violate Microsoft’s Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy, Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, or Standards of Business Conduct. Individuals are responsible for knowing and abiding by these standards.

Unacceptable behavior includes (without limitation):

1. **No disrespectful behavior**. This includes threats, harassment, stalking, abuse, slurs, profanity, personal attacks, sexual remarks or innuendos, physical violence, public speculation about others and any other behavior that Microsoft deems inconsistent Microsoft culture and standards.
2. **No impersonations** of a Microsoft employee, agent, manager, host or another user.
3. **No illegal or offensive activities**. Do not publish, post, distribute or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene or other unlawful material or discussion.
4. **Accountability**. RDs are fully responsible and liable for anything they say (whether orally or in writing) or do. This includes any actions taken based on advice or information received in online forums or elsewhere, how an RD conducts themselves as a community leader and interactions with other RDs, customers, and the general public.
5. **No libel or slander against Microsoft or other persons or entities**. Libel includes false statements made in written form, such as statements posted to forums or other publicly accessible websites, electronic mail or any other printed form.
6. **No NDA violations**. To access and/or participate in engagement opportunities that provide confidential or proprietary information in the RD Program, you must sign a Microsoft Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA), because as an RD you may receive Microsoft confidential or proprietary information that is not available to the public. By signing the NDA or by accepting your invitation to the RD Program, you agree not to disclose any confidential or proprietary information. Additional NDAs may be required for participation in specific opportunities (for example, event and individual product beta NDAs).
7. **No plagiarism**. Individuals may only post original work or work that they have written permission to post. Learn more about copyright at: [https://www.microsoft.com/legal/Copyright/Default.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/Copyright/Default.aspx )
8. **No discrimination or harassment**. Microsoft is committed to providing a harassment-free experience to Program participants regardless of age, ancestry, color, gender identity or expression, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical size, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, veteran status, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation or technology choices. Harassment is unwelcome verbal, physical or virtual behavior based on the characteristics identified above.
9. **No sexual harassment**. Sexual harassment is unwelcome verbal, physical or virtual behavior based on sex and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same or different gender. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:

   • Unwelcome sexual advances  
   • Sexual comments or inappropriate gender-based jokes  
   • Excessive, unwelcome romantic attention  
   • Offering or conditioning an employment benefit or preferential treatment, like a promotion or job assignment, in exchange for sexual favors
   • Unwelcome physical contact  
   • Sharing or displaying sexually explicit content  
   • Using sexually degrading words  

All RD Program participants should be kind, professional, and respectful to others.

## Reporting

If you become aware of a conduct violation on or offline, you are encouraged to report it to [RD Program Support](mailto:rdprogram@microsoft.com).

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Program or event staff immediately.

If you don’t feel comfortable going through one of these channels, you can raise an anonymous concern via the [Microsoft Runs on Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/integrity) website.

## Enforcement  

Participation in the RD Program is a privilege and Microsoft reserves the right to remove any participant from the RD Program for violating this Code of Conduct. The determination to remove a person from the Program is made on a case-by-case basis at Microsoft's sole discretion.  Decisions to remove an RD are final.  When an RD is removed from the program, we retire the remaining benefits and his/her access to Microsoft resources.
