  ## Bio 
  As a Microsoft Regional Director, Microsoft Certified Trainer, Process Improvement, and Productivity Expert, Sharon's background in Software Development, Business and Systems Analysis, Project Management, and Agile combined with her Developmental Psychology degree and Six Sigma Black Belt blend perfectly with her love of helping and training people to make her a well-rounded leader, consultant, and coach.

  Solving both process and technical problems, Sharon has the unique ability to listen and uncover client pain points to develop a plan that will not only build the needed solutions, but to also drive change, adoption, and education in a way not typically seen from technical consultants.

  Sharon is the founder and CEO of Smarter Consulting, a business and technology consulting services company. She founded her business as a way to grow and diversify the technology resource pool by providing opportunity to underserved individuals such as women and minorities by providing them with the opportunity and support to add a technical skill set to their existing industry business experience. The ultimate goal is to create a business environment based on diversity, inclusion, and opportunity.

  Being part of the community is extremely important to her and she is an active leader, participant, and mentor. She is the lead organizer for SharePoint Saturday Kansas City and founder of the Kansas City O365 User Group. She is the Founding President and a past board member of the Kansas City IIBA chapter and currently serves as a board member for the Digital Women of Kansas City as the Digital Chair.

  In her “spare time”, Sharon speaks professionally at local, national, and global events and teaches subjects such as Office 365, Business Analysis, Six Sigma, Leadership, and other continuing education courses publicly as an adjunct instructor for the local community college and privately for business all over the country/region. 

  When she's not working, Sharon is likely reading self-improvement books, hanging out with her family, or on a cruise out of the country/region with no access to communication.
