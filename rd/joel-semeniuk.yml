  ## Bio
  Hey there, I’m Joel. I’m a Entrepreneur living in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
  I am a fan of photography, music and especially technology. I'm a founder of a
  number of startups, however, my core company is called
  [Imaginet](http://www.imaginet.com)which I helped establish in 1997. I'm a
  serial entrepreneur - I can't stop myself. I work almost exclusively with
  executives at either very large organizations or with startups on how to
  reimagine business with technology such as the cloud, mobile, AI, and
  augmented reality - with special attention to technology that enables more
  efficient collaboration and productivity.
  
  I'm proud to be a Global Microsoft Regional Director. I'm also an active
  public speaker, as well as innovation & leadership mentor and coach. Oh yeah..
  I've written a bunch of books that you can search for and buy on Amazon!
  
  Talk to me about: Software Engineering, ALM, Agile, Lean, Microsoft Surface
  Hub, Microsoft Hololens, Augmented Reality, Innovation, Industry 4.0,
  Technology Trends, Software Architecture, IoT, Machine Learning, SaaS, IaaS,
  PaaS, Microsoft Office 365, Skype for Business, DevOps, Executive Coaching,
  Startups, and Enterprise Innovation

  ## Spotlight
  I’m the founder and Chief Innovation Officer of Imaginet. I create
  environments for our customers where innovation can be created and flourish.
  Today businesses face some difficult problems, namely how to leverage emerging
  technologies to optimize and differentiate their business in the age of
  disruption. This problem is compounded by the sheer spectrum of technology
  businesses must consider. They can no longer solely rely on web presence or
  simple mobile apps to engage customers; they must think about how technologies
  such as cloud, machine learning, bots, drones and advancements to digital
  collaboration fit together to redefine both employee and customer experiences.
  
  Over the past 5 years I’ve been working with executives from startups to the
  Fortune 100 from around the world to help navigate these problems. I encourage
  them to think 3-5 years into the future, helping them reimagine engagement and
  value with emerging technology. From helping organizations get the most out of
  the Microsoft Surface Hub to providing strategies on moving existing data and
  platforms to the cloud, the impacts of thinking holistically about how
  technology platforms work to completely reshape everything from collaborative
  operations to how the organizations stay competitive and vibrant in an era of
  continual disruption.
