  ## Bio
  An entrepreneur, speaker, and visionary in the web design industry, Beatriz Oliveira is the founder and CEO of BindTuning, one of the leading platforms for building connected and engaging workplaces for Microsoft Office 365 and SharePoint.

  Beatriz graduated top of her class in IT Engineering by Minho University in 1997 and started her professional career that same year as a consultant at Ernst & Young, working for 2 years in multiple large-scale projects in several industries like telecommunications, banking, insurances, amongst others.

  In 1999, Beatriz co-founded her first company, CentralBiz, a Microsoft-focused services company, where she took the lead as Creative Director. CentralBiz was one of the first companies to sell SharePoint solutions in Portugal.

  After selling her share at CentralBiz, Beatriz invested a couple years, from 2003-2005, in developing her Communication and Design skills by taking a masters in Portugal’s most highly regarded design university – IADE.

  In 2005 Beatriz founded Bind, a web-focused consulting company with a high focus on developing web solutions for .NET-based CMS systems. Bind is, to date, the parent company of BindTuning.

  After a serious accident in 2008, Beatriz used her recovery time doing what she loved best – creating web themes for DotNetNuke – and for the first time started selling them online. Her designs quickly became top sellers, leading her to refocus Bind to a theme development company. This fortuitous success led to her "aha" moment - conceptualizing "skin tuning" and extending the tool to a dozen other platforms. BindTuning was born in 2011.

  In the last 10 years Beatriz has been a speaker in international events in several countries/regions and has been putting her technical and design expertise to the service of developing groundbreaking UX solutions for Microsoft technologies.

  Beatriz is actively involved in STEM education for youth, hosting monthly coding events for children in the BindTuning offices. She is also an ardent supporter of women in technology. 

  Beatriz is currently the President of the Portuguese IAMCP chapter, and an advisor to the council of ESMAD university.

  A Microsoft Regional Director, Microsoft Office Development MVP and Certified Professional (MCP), Beatriz is a wife and mother of two daughters. She currently resides in Porto, Portugal.
