  ## Bio
  I'm David Rodriguez, a Spanish [Microsoft Regional Director](http://davidjrh.intelequia.com/2018/04/microsoft-regional-director.html)
  and [Azure Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000309), living in Tenerife, Canary Islands. 
  On 2011, I co-founded Intelequia Software Solutions, a company focused on helping customers to adopt the cloud model, as well as the [TenerifeDev](http://www.meetup.com/tenerifedev) user group. 
 
  Over the last years I worked at DNN Corp. (a.k.a. DotNetNuke) as the 
  Cloud Team Lead engineer, building Evoq OnDemand and the new microservices
  architecture for DNN Platform based products and services. I have authored some
  open source modules for DNN and Azure available at GitHub, allowing to integrate 
  Azure AD, Redis, Application Insights and many other services in the platform. 
 
  You can find me organizing the local user group once or twice per month, mainly 
  talking about cloud related matters, and lately on building intelligent apps and 
  bots with cognitive services, and of course, at the Global Azure Bootcamp in Madrid. I 
  don't miss any Microsoft Inspire conference edition, so if you plan to go there we can meet
  and talk with a cup of coffee. BTW, if you come to the island, I will be happy to show you 
  the best ["guachinches"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guachinche) on Tenerife, only local
  people know the best ones.
