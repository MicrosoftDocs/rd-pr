remarks: |
  ## Bio
  I am Chief Architect, DevOps & Modern Software at BlueMetal, a division of Insight. 
  I am also a member of the .NET Foundation Advisory Council 
  and am responsible for its code signing services. I have been 
  a Microsoft MVP for Windows Platform Development since 2014, a 
  Microsoft MVP for Visual Studio and Development Technologies 
  since 2016, and a Xamarin MVP since 2016.  My prior 
  experience ranges from building identity solutions for global 
  organizations, developing real-time trading systems dealing with 
  massive amounts of data, to the complex data models of equity 
  derivatives and the regulatory needs of Medicaid claims processing. 
  
  I am passionate about reducing friction in the development process 
  and creating modern software solutions to solve complex business 
  challenges. I believe that technology is meaningless in a vacuum I 
  strive to show how the bleeding-edge delivers superior value to our 
  clientsâ€™ bottom line and unlocks new business opportunities.

  I always seek to enable others to be successful. In the community
  that translates to creating libraries, publishing blog articles,
  and doing anything else necessary, to simplify complex problems
  and let developers focus on their end goal.
