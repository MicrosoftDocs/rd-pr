  ## Spotlight
  My company, DevRain Solutions, and I noticed a growing interest from our
  customers needing to extend their presence on different devices and platforms
  , whether they be Windows, iOS, Android, or XBOX One. Previously we used
  native tools and various ecosystems to build all these applications. Starting
  as a one-platform development company, we transitioned to Xamarin which
  allowed us quickly extend the number of platforms, significantly optimize the
  development process, and decrease the average time to market for our products
  and solutions.
  
  We have successfully implemented many solutions for several companies in the
  communication, healthcare, entertainment, and technology industries -
  including solutions on Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Azure Cognitive Services,
  Bot Framework, ASP.NET MVC and Xamarin. For example, I built an intelligent
  search system for blood donors in Ukraine. With this cloud and chatbot-based
  solution, the average time of identifying blood donors was decreased from 3-4
  days to mere hours.
  
  I can provide more accurate vision and technical details to my customers,
  governmental institutions, and community thanks to the two-directional
  communication with Microsoft visionaries and access to resources and tutorials
  provided by the Regional Director Program.
