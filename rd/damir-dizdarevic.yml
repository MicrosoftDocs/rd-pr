  ## Bio
  I am a mathematician and an IT professional with strong business focus living
  in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. My current position is the Executive
  Director and Deputy CEO of Logosoft d.o.o. – an IT company that is part of
  Telecom Serbia group. I've been with this company for 13 years and I have 20+
  years of experience in the IT industry, particularly in Microsoft
  technologies. As I've also been an MVP for 10 years, I'm strongly engaged in
  community work throughout the whole region of ex-Yugoslavia. I am a founder
  and president of Bosnian MSCommunity. I’ve also worked as an MCT and a
  consultant since 2005. In the last 15 years I have delivered hundreds of
  sessions on Microsoft technologies at many conferences, but also as classroom
  trainings. I'm still very active in conference speaking and I also write
  Microsoft Official Courses from time to time.
  
  As a part of my current position in Logosoft, I'm very interested and engaged
  in process of transforming old fashioned telco companies into modern ICT
  companies. That's something that I work on in my day-to-day activities.
  
  When it comes to technology today, I'm mostly interested in identity
  management in hybrid environments - both in cloud and on-premise. I'm also
  very interested in mobility and MDM. You can talk with me about Windows
  Server, Exchange, Office365, Azure, EMS, Intune and MIM.
  
  In my personal life, I am a father of two lovely girls with a third lovely
  girl being my wife. When I have time, I try to support various civil and NGO
  initiatives.
