  ## Bio
  Even after 20 years in the space, my passion for technology and the
  transformation it can bring is a primary reason I get out of bed each morning.
  My career has involved both business and technical management roles, and I
  credit that experience for giving me a deep understanding of the priorities
  and concerns of both sides of the organization. I have gotten to know first-
  hand that the success and effectiveness of any technology initiative within an
  organization is directly related to the quality of the communication between
  these two sides of the business and building bridges between the two is a part
  of the work I do every day.
  
  I have an extensive IT Pro background in both on-premises and cloud
  infrastructure as well as many years working with both well-established and
  innovative new collaboration technologies. In my current role as Sr. VP of
  Product Strategy for an industry-leading ISV that builds migration,
  management, governance/compliance and productivity solutions on the Microsoft
  Azure platform, I have the good fortune to work with some of the largest and
  most complex organizations as they begin to pivot their business to a cloud
  first, mobile first world. While I love consulting directly with customers
  about their specific needs, I am also a regular speaker at industry events and
  conferences and frequently have the good fortune to contribute to press and
  analyst research.
  
  Best of all, my corporate life gives me lots of opportunities to pursue other
  passions like traveling and experiencing the many and varied food cultures of
  the world.
