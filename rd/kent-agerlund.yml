  ## Bio
  As an author, speaker, trainer, evangelist, chief technical architect, and
  founder of CT Global (formerly Coretech Global), I specialize in solutions. My
  technology background has given me an in-depth knowledge and expertise to
  understand the needs of many diverse enterprises. As Microsoft Regional
  Director for the Nordics and Benelux, I am pleased I can now lend my support
  to broader Microsoft community.
  
  I’m a frequent speaker at industry events such as Microsoft Ignite, MMS,
  System Center Universe, Devconnections, local user groups around the globe and
  am the main author of Mastering Configuration Manager and other Enterprise
  Client Management books. I’m actively involved in communities like TechNet
  forums, local user groups, and is awarded Microsoft Most Valuable Professional
  (MVP) for his work with Microsoft Enterprise mobility. I’m probably best known
  for using “Real World” scenarios to demonstrate solutions and ability to reach
  the core issue.
  
  My company, CT Global (formally Coretech Global), is a global cloud platform
  consultancy rapidly expanding worldwide. A team of industry experts, CT Global
  provides decades of experience and a passion for sharing knowledge about
  technology, tools, methods, and progressive solutions to meet the ever-
  evolving needs of the digital world.
