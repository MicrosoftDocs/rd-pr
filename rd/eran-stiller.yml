  ## Bio
  I’m Eran Stiller - a software architect, consultant, instructor and technology addict. 
  I most enjoy architecting, designing and developing large-scale software solutions, 
  ranging from simple on-premise systems to highly-distributed highly-available cloud 
  scale web & mobile applications. With many years of experience in software development 
  and architecture and a track record of public speaking and community contribution, 
  I am recognized as a Microsoft MVP on Microsoft Azure since 2016 and as Microsoft Regional 
  Director since 2018. 

  A Co-Founder at CodeValue Ltd., I practice software architecture at various clients on an 
  almost daily basis, reviewing many designs in many professional fields. As CodeValue’s 
  Chief Technology Officer, I am in charge of many of CodeValue’s projects and customer solutions
  as well as the technical ability of our employees' to create these solutions. In addition, 
  I perform software consultations on various topics including architecture and design reviews, 
  Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Web APIs and many others. I am also highly experienced 
  in technologically leading, architecting and developing software frameworks of various abstraction 
  levels, ranging from low-level application frameworks up to fully fledged distributed system hosts.

  I instruct various software courses and workshops and I am a frequent [public speaker](https://stiller.blog/public-speaking/) 
  at various international events and user groups on topics I find especially interesting. 
  Furthermore, I am a co-organizer of [Azure Israel](https://www.meetup.com/azureisrael) which 
  meets every once in a while to discuss all things related to Microsoft Azure.

  On the Academic side, I am a graduate of the Israeli Air-Force’s prestigious “Talpiot” program. 
  I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics from the Hebrew University at Jerusalem; 
  as well as an M.B.A. (with Honors) in Business Management from the Tel-Aviv University. In addition,
  I am an avid pastry chef and photographer, so if you ever need a cake or a good picture - you know
  who to call.
