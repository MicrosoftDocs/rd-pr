  ## Spotlight
  At my company, Axinom, we reinvent the way people consume digital media and
  services at home, at work and while traveling by providing them with the next
  generation of digital platforms for entertainment, infotainment and
  e-commerce.
  
  In our customer projects, we see that consumers expect premium video to be
  protected and delivered in the best possible way on a wide range of devices.
  This quality of service on a global scale is anything but easy to achieve.
  
  We worked closely with Microsoft product groups to leverage Azure Media
  Services, an extensible cloud-based platform for scalable media management and
  delivery applications. Leveraging Axinom products in Azure, our customers can
  store, encode, and manage videos utilizing the richness of the Microsoft Azure
  cloud platform and instantly create and deploy cloud-based video platforms,
  such as VOD portals for consumer and corporate video. The Azure Marketplace
  offering helped us to extend the benefits to our customers and partners making
  it easier for them to evaluate Axinom products with a free trial.
  
  Thanks to the investment in the cloud, Axinom was selected as one of 101
  companies that matter most in online video in 2016 for the second year in a
  row.
