  ## Bio
  I’m co-founder and CTO of Logical Advantage in Charlotte, North Carolina. We
  are dedicated to helping companies build better IoT and software solutions
  faster.
  
  I love my job! We work with some of the most incredible software architects,
  software developers, business analysts and PMs in the region who place a high
  importance on community and learning. I get to focus on emerging technologies
  and help to ensure that our projects are architected to meet the client's
  current and future needs.
  
  Awarded by Microsoft as a Regional Director that consists of some of the
  world's top technology visionaries from over 50 countries chosen specifically
  for cross-platform expertise, community leadership, and commitment to business
  results. I'm president and founder of the Charlotte Internet of Things (IoT)
  and the Logical Advantage Charlotte Tech Talks user groups. I'm on the
  steering committee of the Regional Internet of Things and the Enterprise
  Developers Guild. I was awarded Microsoft Most Valuable Professional MVP for
  my engagement in the community around IoT/cloud. I'm an accomplished open
  source contributor and my articles and videos have over a million views.
  
  Before Logical Advantage, I served as application development director for the
  largest Microsoft Business Solutions Partner in the Carolinas. During this
  time, my team won two global Microsoft Pinnacle awards.
  
  I attended North Carolina State University on a full scholarship program with
  General Motors, and graduated summa cum laude with dual degrees in Electrical
  Engineering and Computer Engineering.
  
  I am a fan of IoT, cloud services, and practically any technology- basically a
  total geek. I love spending time with my family and I’m also interested in
  DIY, hiking and being outdoors.
  
  Talk to me about: IoT, Industrial IoT (IIoT), Cloud computing, Azure IoT Hub
  and enterprise software development!
