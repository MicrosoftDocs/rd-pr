Andreas endorses speaking and workshop engagements.
  In his spare time, he enjoys good company, good conversations, good food and sometimes good wine – in that order. He also is not shy to admit that he loves computer games and watching movies but has a genuine interest into learning about and experiencing diverse viewpoints and different cultures.
  If there is one think Andreas would want you to do it is not to not hesitate to reach out to him if you are interested to talk to him. He will try to make it work and may even be interested to travel to where you are.
