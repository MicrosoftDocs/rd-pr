  ## Bio
  I am the founder and co-owner of [Arana Software](http://www.aranasoft.com), a
  web software consulting firm based out of Detroit, St. Louis, and Las Vegas.
  
  As a software consultant, I have been developing solutions on the web since
  1995, when the Blink tag lured me away from Visual Basic 3. Through my
  collaboration and contributions to software development, I have been awarded
  as a Microsoft Regional Director, an ASPInsider, and as a six-time Microsoft
  MVP.
  
  Recognizing that the bottleneck to great software is a developer’s time, my
  continuing quest is for frameworks, modules, tools, and practices that make
  developers stronger, fitter, happier, and more productive. "Typing is not the
  hardest part of the day;" I strive for efficiency in implementation, so that
  we can focus on imagining ideas, solving problems, and providing solutions.
  
  I am also president of [GiveCamp Inc.](http://givecamp.org/), a non-profit
  through which software developers, graphic designers, social media experts and
  other technologists volunteer their time and skills to help their local
  charities.
