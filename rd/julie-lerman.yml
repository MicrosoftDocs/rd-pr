  ## Bio
  I've been building software solutions for businesses for nearly 30 years and
  now focus on helping development teams plan and architect their software. I'm
  a [Microsoft Regional Director](https://rd.microsoft.com) (one of about 150
  around the world) with strong ties to a number of teams at Microsoft. I've
  also been recognized as a Microsoft MVP since 2003 for my technical expertise
  and my community involvement. In 2018, I was made a member of the [Docker Captains]
  (https://www.docker.com/docker-captains) program.
  
  In addition to coaching software teams, I present at software conferences
  around the world on Microsoft technologies with a focus on Entity Framework
  and Azure services and am excited to be leveraging Microsoft's new
  direction with cross-platform and open source technologies. My speaking
  engagements and mentorship also lean heavily on practices from Domain-Driven
  Design and even talks to share some of the wisdom I've gained over the years.
  
  I am the author of the highly acclaimed “Programming Entity Framework” books,
  the MSDN Magazine Data Points column and many popular videos on
  [Pluralsight.com](http://pluralsight.com/).
  
  While participating in a truly global community, my heart belongs to the tech
  community in Vermont. I founded the [Vermont.NET](http://meetup.com/vtcode)
  user group in 2002 and we continue to have monthly meetings all these years
  later. The .NET community fostered a variety of other tech communities and
  many of them share our meetup which is over 1500 strong. I initiated the
  [Vermont Code Camp](http://www.vtcodecamp.org) in 2009 and continue to be a
  lead co-organizer annually. Our code camp is now an annual event drawing
  nearly 200 attendees and speakers across a wide variety of technology stacks
  and entices quite a few people from other parts of the country/region to participate
  as well. I was a founding board member of the Vermont Software Developer
  Alliance and served on the board for its first 3 critical years. VTSDA has
  morphed to the [Vermont Technical Alliance](http://www.vtta.org) and is an
  important player in the Vermont technical business community. I am also an
  Executive Fellow of [BTVIgnite](http://www.btvignite.com), a partner of
  [USIgnite](https://www.us-ignite.org/)whose mission is to spark next-gen
  applications in gigabit enabled communities across the United States.
  
  Feel free to contact me about working with your team on site, remotely or even
  in Vermont where I live, if you'd like an excuse to visit my beautiful state.

  ## Spotlight
  As Microsoft has been embracing cross-platform technologies, I noticed many
  .NET developers were concerned about Microsoft losing focus on them. As a
  long-time Windows platform developer, myself, I decided to “take the plunge”
  on their behalf. So, I purchased my first Apple computer, learned how to use
  it and started writing .NET applications using Visual Studio Code – right on
  OS X. I loved the reactions of my techie friends who saw me whipping out a
  MacBook, typing some bash commands and deploying to Docker on Azure!
  
  The novelty of being able to debug and run .NET and C# apps in OS X was fun,
  but also enlightening. I now frequently use both OS X and Windows in
  Pluralsight and Channel 9 videos, podcast interviews, conferences and articles
  to teach .NET developers two important things: first, that Microsoft isn’t
  abandoning Windows or asking us to do so. Instead, other developers can now
  share in the coding experiences that we are so proud of: .NET, C# and powerful
  IDEs. And second, that .NET Framework and Visual Studio continue to evolve.
  
  I’ve been fortunate to leverage my reputation to assure Windows developers
  that .NET and Windows programming remain a smart investment and career path.
