  ## Bio
  Hello! My name is Elemar Júnior. 
 
  I help developers and IT executives to develop software that meets business needs. I have been using Microsoft technologies for more than 20 years, developing software for 3D interior design, industrial automation, and business integration.
 
  As a consultant, I am dealing with various aspects of cross-platform architecture and technologies. From legacy software to the cloud. From powerful servers to IoT devices. My passion is to build software solutions that can run anywhere.
 
  I am a specialist developing software for complex domains, and in scenarios that demand computation-intensive solutions. Also, I am excited about productivity and innovation.
 
  The events I speak at span from technical conferences to executive-style events in various verticals with a CxO audience.
 
  For being active in the international enterprise architecture, software architecture & software development communities, I have been awarded as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) since 2011.
