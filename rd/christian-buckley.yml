  ## Bio
  As a Microsoft Regional Director and Office Servers & Services MVP, I have a deep background in collaboration, social and graph-based   
  technology, supply chain, and marketing tech. I am the Founder & CEO of CollabTalk LLC, an independent research and technical marketing 
  services firm, providing fractional-CMO services for ISVs and SIs, and through my partnership with the Marriott School of Management at 
  Brigham Young University, I also provide research services to tech companies. Additionally, I'm the CMO for revealit.io, an AI and 
  blockchain-powered interactive video technology company.
  
  I've been involved with SharePoint since 2005, but have been working with various social and collaboration technologies since the 
  late 1990's, including several years consulting around project and portfolio management systems (I used to build PMOs), but more 
  recently Azure and blockchain have been consuming more and more of my attention as this space grows. 

  Part of my Microsoft career was spent with the team that launched a hosted SharePoint platform, now part of office 365, after which 
  I spent almost a decade as a chief evangelist and chief marketing officer for several leading SharePoint ISVs, and was instrumental 
  in 2 major acquisitions. Within the community, I have helped launch and run more than a dozen annual SharePoint Saturday events across 
  the West Coast and Canada, co-founded the Seattle chapter of IAMCP (International Association of Microsoft Channel Partners), and have 
  been on the board of the Puget Sound (Seattle) SharePoint User Group (PSSPUG), and Utah SPUG. As an RD, I am especially interested in 
  driving Microsoft-focused community events within Utah, including the Insider Dev Tour (June 2018), Azure Blockchain event (Sep 2018),
  Windows Dev Boot Camp (Oct 2018), and our 7th annual SharePoint Saturday Utah (Feb 2019).

  When not working with clients or speaking at events around the world, I am an active blogger at [http://www.buckleyplanet.com] and on 
  various communities sites, and I produce a couple series of vlogs with fellow MVPs and community members that you can find at 
  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2EUj3XnyWZt55Bb0tA7TBw]. I'm also a HUGE 80's new wave music fan.
