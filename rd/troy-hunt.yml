  ## Bio
  I'm Troy Hunt, an Australian [Microsoft Regional
  Director](https://www.troyhunt.com/2016/03/microsoft-regional-director.html)
  and [Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-
  us/overview.aspx). I'm also the creator of the [Have I Been
  Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) (HIBP) data breach notification service and
  [I've peviously testified in front of US Congress on the impact of data breaches](https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-im-telling-us-congress-about-data-breaches/).
  
  
  I don't work for Microsoft, but
  they're kind enough to recognise my community contributions by way of their
  award programs which I've been an awardee of since 2011. I get to interact
  with some fantastic people building their best products and then share what I
  know about creating secure applications for the web with the broader
  community.
  
  I'm [a Pluralsight author of many top-rating courses on web
  security](https://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/troy-hunt) and other
  technologies. There's no better way to get up to speed on a topic quickly than
  through professional training that you can take at your own pace. As both an
  author and a student, I have nothing but positive things to say about the
  breadth and quality of Pluralsight courses.
  
  For fourteen years prior to going fully independent, I worked at Pfizer with
  the last seven years being responsible for application architecture in the
  Asia Pacific region. Time spent in a large corporate environment gave me huge
  exposure to all aspects of technology as well as the diverse cultures my role
  spanned. Many of the things I teach in post-corporate life are based on these
  experiences, particularly as a result of working with a large number of
  outsourcing vendors across the globe. For more corporatey background, there's
  always my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/troyhunt).
  
  One of the key projects I'm involved in today is HIBP, a free service that aggregates
  data breaches and helps people establish if they've been impacted by malicious
  activity on the web. As well as being a useful service for the community, HIBP
  has given me an avenue to ship code that runs at scale on Microsoft's Azure
  cloud platform, one of the best ways we have of standing up services on the
  web today.

  ## Spotlight
  A few years ago, I analysed data breaches and saw some alarming trends. Most
  notably was the prevalence with which the same people appeared in multiple
  incidents, usually unbeknownst to them. I decided to create a solution to help
  people monitor their exposure in data breaches called “Have I been pwned”
  (HIBP). HIBP served the community by informing those impacted by these
  incidents, but also enabled me to showcase how modern apps can be built on
  Azure using cutting edge cloud paradigms. Fast forward to present day and the
  service now holds billions of records from hundreds of serious security
  incidents worldwide.
  
  I wanted to demonstrate how much can be done with how little; in fact, the
  goal has always been to run it at a cost comparable to my daily cappuccinos.
  HIBP has enabled me to demonstrate how to apply features such as autoscale on
  Azure App Service and highlight the value proposition of non-traditional
  services, namely the rapid development, elasticity and commoditised pricing of
  Azure. Through my work I’ve built a deep knowledge of Azure which has since
  translated to numerous articles, conference talks and training courses.
  
  HIBP receives millions of requests an hour and continues to be run on the
  aforementioned “coffee budget”. It’s been highlighted by the world’s largest
  media outlets, reaching hundreds of millions of people, whilst regularly being
  showcased as a “how to” of modern cloud architecture.
