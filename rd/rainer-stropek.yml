  ## Bio
  Hi, my name is Rainer Stropek. I am co-founder and CEO of software architects
  serving this role since 2008. At software architects, we develop the award-
  winning SaaS solution "time cockpit". Additionally, we help our customers to
  make the move to Cloud Computing and SaaS. Previously, I founded and led two
  IT consulting firms doing development and consulting work on Microsoft's
  technology stack.
  
  Beside my job at software architects, I do a lot of work in IT communities. I
  have written numerous books and articles on C#, web and database development,
  and Microsoft Azure. I regularly speak at conferences, workshops and trainings
  in Europe and the US. In 2010, I have become one of the first MVPs for the
  Microsoft Azure platform. In 2015, I also became a Microsoft Regional
  Director. Since 2015, I have been chairman of the Coding Club Linz where we
  organize community events and the local CoderDojo, a free programming club for
  kids.
  
  I graduated the Higher Technical School Leonding (AT) for MIS with honors and
  hold a BSc (Hons) Computer Studies of the University of Derby (UK).
  
  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing, SaaS, PaaS, DevOps, Azure, Software
  Architectures, Software Engineering, .NET, Angular, TypeScript, Web API, C#

  ## Spotlight
  DevOps, Microservices and Cloud Computing are gamechangers for enterprise
  software development. Working as a speaker, trainer and consultant, I have
  seen many programmers and architects struggling to fully adopt these new
  development paradigms, technologies and tools.
  
  Together with the product marketing team of Microsoft Western Europe, I
  conceptualized a two-day “Practical DevOps Training” targeted at Microsoft
  partners and large customers. Its goal was to deepen the knowledge about
  DevOps. Attendees should learn about the processes and tools necessary for
  DevOps to succeed like continuous integration and delivery, automated testing,
  etc. We didn’t want to stop with theory. Many practical exercises with
  Microsoft Azure and the Visual Studio product family are a vital part of the
  workshop.
  
  I have put together training materials consisting of slide decks, a consistent
  sample for both days and eight practical hands-on exercises. All material was
  published on GitHub so that as many people as possible can benefit from it.
  The Practical DevOps Training was delivered in 12 European locations in 8
  different languages. We welcomed 300 attendees from 170 different Microsoft
  partners and enterprise customers. Because of its success, we will do a
  follow-up training focusing on mobile DevOps in 2016/17. The Practical DevOps
  Training gave attendees a head start for DevOps and Microsoft’s cloud
  technologies. The knowledge gained from these trainings enables them to
  reimagine their DevOps, leading to increased agility, better reliability, and
  faster time to market.
