  ## Bio
  CTO at Connecting Software and co-founder of 365 Community (www.365portal.org),
  a non-profit organization whose mission is to empower communities around the world with better ICT processes for customer relationship management and customer service.
  I'm a Microsoft MVP for Azure and AI, and a regular speaker at international IT conferences (https://sessionize.com/stefano-tempesta).
  My interests extend to blockchain and AI-related technologies.
  I like to consider myself a technology ambassador of beautiful software,
  experienced in the end-to-end software development practice and agile team leadership.
  A passionate traveler, a poor musician, and an avid learner of new technologies and (programming) languages.
  Have a can-do think-positive attitude. People say I live at a different speed.
  I hold British and Italian citizenship, and speak fluent English, Italian, and terrible Russian.
