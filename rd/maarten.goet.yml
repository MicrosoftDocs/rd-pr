  ## Spotlight
  As an RD I've always been on the forefront of cloud development. With an
  infrastructure background and having been involved in many projects as an
  architect I am frequently asked to reimagine datacenters and applications, and
  prepare them for the cloud-era.
  
  Recently I've worked with a pharmaceuticals company who produces precision
  medication and has highly automated labs around the world to make them. They
  needed to better support their pharmacists so that they could optimize
  medicine for their local markets.
  
  Using a familiar automation principle, we created a datacenter migration
  program and moved all applications and resources into Microsoft Azure, and
  configured Operations Management Suite so that they would be audit compliant,
  and would be in control of their cloud operations. That now allows them to
  enter new markets quickly; taking the automation and templates we've created
  and using any of the 32+ Azure regions too stand up a new 'cloud datacenter'
  within one week.
  
  With this fundament in place we helped them utilize Azure's data capabilities.
  By connecting Microsoft Dynamics into Azure SQL, Azure Analytics Services and
  PowerBI, local pharmacists can now intelligently analyze their breadth of data
  and provide more targeted medicine solutions.
